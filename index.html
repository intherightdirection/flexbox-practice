        <p>Jared here, just learning about flexbox so I can do some awesome responsive web pages. I really need to
          keep my mind on something and just practicing web development,
          mostly CSS and JavaScript for now, seems like
          a really constructive thing to do.</p>
      </main>

      <div class="div-1">
        <p>A movie I like? There are so many, I don't think I can pick just one as a favorite. There are 3
          trilogies that top the list; The Matrix (now a 4 part saga), The Lord of the Rings and original
          Starwars. Even when I like movies I don't care to usually see them more than once or twice. These
          trilogies I have watched each in its entirety over 4 times.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="div-2">
        <p>A tv show I like? I watch so many tv series. TV time is something I have seemed to cut
          back on. One show that I have followed from the beginning, so I might say it's my favorite is The
          Walking Dead. Really, anything set in the Walking Dead Universe has my interest but the original
          series has held a place in my heart for 11 years.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="div-3">
        <p>A band I listen to? At one time listening to music was the one thing I did the most of. Listening to
          music or going to local shows. I would see smaller bands in other cities quite often. This is no
          longer something I do. I am an older, out of shape man. One band from that time that I still listen
          too all of their stuff is Madball. I have seen and heard a lot of bands and no other band has been
          on the top of my list of fantastic bands. They have also released a lot of material over a good part
          of my youth. All of which I loved.</p>
